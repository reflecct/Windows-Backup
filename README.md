# Windows Backup Batch
This batch is focused on automating backup process on Windows 11. It supports a backup without VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) and wbengine (Windows Backup Service).
This project is for fun, if anyone uses it i'm glad but don't take it very serious.
If you are on custom windows that have Backup feature removed this script won't work (unless you use Manual Backup feature).
Also please don't use Manual Backup if you have Virtual Box that takes a lot of resources or you are using smth like ollama and have local AI models.
